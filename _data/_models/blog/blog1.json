	"more_content": "<p>Here, it couldn&rsquo;t be easier to find your way to the top designer brands and best stores. What can be elusive, however, is the best deals. And that&rsquo;s where things go a bit &hellip; underground.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re called &ldquo;sample sales,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll discover more than samples when you find one. Usually these sales are just a way for top designers to clear their shelves of the previous season&rsquo;s product. These sales pop up in unexpected places and can be difficult to find: warehouse spaces, temporarily vacant retail spaces, even hotel conference spaces.</p>\n<p>So, keep this between us, ok?
