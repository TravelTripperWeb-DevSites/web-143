In a city where the best art isn&rsquo;t necessarily mainstream, can be subversive, and is often found in surprising places, you have to know where to look. Here are a few tips.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Clio Art Fair</strong></p>\n<p>Dubbed &ldquo;the anti-fair,&rdquo; the Clio Art Fair is dedicated to discovering independent artists.This fair features artists without any exclusive NYC gallery representation and seeks to give their work wider exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next Clio Art Fair is happening this month March 2-5. Artists presenting their work at Clio use many different materials, but there&rsquo;s a common thread of playfulness and spontaneous creativity that runs through much of the fair.We think you&rsquo;ll find the experience eclectic, different, interesting, and worth it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Art on Paper</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/414_450_2203/media/2017-03-16-163425/art on paper.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The venue for Art on Paper is itself a sight to behold. Pier 36 in Lower Manhattan is a 70,000-square-foot facility on the East River where you can enjoy great views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Statue of Liberty. The event is only in its third edition but has experienced growing and enthusiastic crowds at each installment. The gist of the event is as simple as its title: all the art you&rsquo;ll see is made on or with paper. But, as with all great artists, when you give them boundaries those boundaries will be transcended. Expect to see paper do and be what you never imagined it could. Art on Paper will take place March 2-5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Asia Week New York</strong></p>\n<p>Asia Week New York is about celebration. For one week in March, every year since 2009, Asia Week New York brings people together to celebrate and promote Asian art in the city.

Open House Weekend takes place on Saturday and Sunday, March 11&ndash;12, and exhibitions remain open the following week through Saturday, March 18.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Affordable Art Fair</strong></p>\n<p>True to its name, the Affordable Art Fair is just that. Affordable. It was founded in 1999 to make great art accessible to everyone. Explore local, national, and international galleries featuring sculptures, photography, and paintings.
