            <h2>Near Our Hotel in Flatiron NYC</h2>
            <p>The Flatiron Building, originally known as the Fuller Building, was erected in 1902 and designed by Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. The structure stands at 22 stories high and the narrow end of the triangle-shaped building measures only six feet wide. The Flatiron Building is designed in the Beaux-Arts style, featuring French and&nbsp;Italian Renaissance influences. The building was originally home to a Chicago contracting firm called The Fuller Company, but they vacated in 1929. In the following years, the Flatiron neighborhood was quite barren until the 1990s when the building itself began to attract tourists and photographers, which catapulted the Flatiron District into trendy status among New Yorkers. Today, the Flatiron Building is one of New York City's most photographed and recognized buildings and is home to many publishing companies. See it when you stay at our hotel in Flatiron NYC.</p>
