            <h1>Explore NoMad District Attractions</h1>
            <h2>Get to Know Our Neighborhood</h2>
            <p>The Evelyn Hotel is located in the heart of New York City's NoMad&nbsp;District, a neighborhood with a rich <a href="/ourhotel/history">history</a> and bright future. The name NoMad, which has been in use since 1999 is derived "NOrth of MADison Square Park", the neighborhood is centered&nbsp;north the urban oasis of Madison Square Park, from 25th Street to 30th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Lexington Avenue. NoMad&nbsp;neighborhood brings together the convenience of midtown and the trendiness of downtown.</p>
            <p>In recent years NoMad&nbsp;District attractions have flourished, with many new restaurants, shops, and buildings opening in the area. Lower Fifth Avenue is a major shopping corridor, and a less-crowded alternative to the busy upper Fifth Avenue. You won't want to miss <a href="http://www.eataly.com/" target="_blank">Eataly</a>, a mecca of Italian cuisine, which contains multiple restaurants, wine bars, a gourmet food hall, and rooftop beer garden, making it a top choice among NoMad things to do. Madison Square Park remains the cultural heart of the neighborhood, and often hosts special events and public art exhibits in the shadow of the Flatiron Building. Many landmarked buildings surround the park, and a stroll around the neighborhood provides an education in the architectural history of New York City. The area just North of the park (termed "NoMad" or NOrth of MADison Square Park) is currently booming, with a selection of trend-setting bars and restaurants that seems to expand each week.</p>
            <p>We invite you to check out some of our favorite spots in the NoMad&nbsp;District with our list of the best attractions <a href="/explore/walkingdistance">within walking distance of our NoMad hotel.</a></p>
