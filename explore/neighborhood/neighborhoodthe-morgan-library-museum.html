            <h1>A Charming New York City Library</h1>
            <h2>The Morgan Library &amp; Museum</h2>
            <p>The Morgan Library &amp; Museum began as the private library of financier Pierpont Morgan (1837&ndash;1913), one of the preeminent collectors and cultural benefactors in the United States.&nbsp;In 1924, eleven years after Pierpont Morgan's death, his son, J. P. Morgan, Jr. (1867&ndash;1943), known as Jack, realized that the library had become too important to remain in private hands. In what constituted one of the most momentous cultural gifts in U.S. history, he fulfilled his father's dream of making the library and its treasures available to scholars and the public alike by transforming it into a public institution now regarded as a must-see NYC library.The Morgan Library &amp; Museum has continued to acquire rare materials as well as important music manuscripts, early children's books, Americana, and materials from the twentieth century.
