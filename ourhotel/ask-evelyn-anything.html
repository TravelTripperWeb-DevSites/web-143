            <p>Evelyn's early 20th century charm has brought in some modern conveniences. I've always said that I look very good for my age!</p>
            <p>You can now text me anytime during your stay with questions, requests, and comments--and I'll get back to you right away.</p>
            <p>I've partnered with a friend of mine, <a href="http://info.aliceapp.com/" onclick="">Alice</a>, a new guest service platform that gives you the ability to connect with my staff, literally at your fingertips!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And I know, the big question is, who is Alice, and what can she do for me? &nbsp;Alice is a platform that is an efficient way for a hotel to engage with you and your needs. &nbsp;In other words, we can get things done for you either by a text or by downloading the app on either the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alice-life-improving-concierge/id705016378?ls=1&amp;mt=8" onclick="">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aliceapp.android.production" onclick="">Android</a>. Whether you need an extra towel or tickets to a Broadway show, we can make this happen quickly and easily for you. &nbsp;</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>I dare you to try - text me at +1 (347) 647 - 2895 anytime while you're staying with me. &nbsp;Emojis are always welcome!&nbsp;</strong></p>
