            <h2>The History of Our Boutique New York Hotel</h2>
            <p>Located in Manhattan's NoMad District, a neighborhood that has played a starring role in NYC history, The Evelyn Hotel is a living testament to the heritage of the neighborhood. In 1903, when our boutique New York hotel was originally built, the area was known as "Tin Pan Alley" and served as the epicenter of the American popular music industry. In its prime during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Tin Pan Alley was a lively place with a steady stream of 
                     adway and Vaudeville performers, musicians, songwriters, and publishers coming and going to the various music houses headquartered in the neighborhood. Among these musical figures was George Gershwin, the composer best known for <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em>, <em>An American in Paris</em>, and the opera<em> Porgy and Bess</em>.</p>
            <p>Designed by architect William H. Birkmire in the Beaux Arts style, Our boutique NYC hotel first opened its doors in 1905 as Hotel Broztell and later became part of the Latham Hotel. One might notice that many other buildings in the neighborhood, including the confident facade of the Flatiron Building, were built in a similar style. Today, the NoMad District has become one of New York City's trendiest neighborhoods and is home to many of the best restaurants, shopping, and attractions in Manhattan. From the Empire State building to Union Square, the NoMad District is an excellent neighborhood to <a href="/explore">explore</a> during your stay in New York City.</p>
